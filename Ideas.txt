* Additional things that would be nice:

X Lock Features (checkbox):
	Locks the shape of the landform.
	User could then modify steepness, total heights, jaggedness, etc.
	Generate/Edit button. Edit only when features are locked.

* Ambitious things to add:

River Generator:
	Brownian motion line generator
	Selectable width/depth?
	or
	Point interpolation with random offsets
	Offsets are maybe brownian or gausian

Lake Generator:
	Random dips
	Selectable width/height?
	or
	Point interpolation, but in a circle
	Offsets done like the rivers


What needs to be done:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Preview line algorithm
	X- code brownian motion in 1d
	  X- debug line stretching part
	X- figure out Java 2d graphics library
	X- make it work with terracing and smoothing
	X- decide if it updates on sliders or on seperate button
	
	Smoothing algorithm
	X- figure out how to use kernels in JIU
	X- figure out how to make it work with terracing
	
	Zoom 2x button
	X- figure out how to stretch images
	
	Locate and fix Bug in redraw?
	X- seems to be based on size (width?) of panel
	
	Menu?
	- else, about button? help button? (maybe not for Img Cert)


preview line smoothing thoughts:
need to store 3 values
do first two before loop, i-1 and i values
draw point1
loop i=1..max-1
 find i+1 value
 smooth using i-1 i and i+1 value
 terrrace
 i-1 = i, i= i+1
end loop
do last point?
